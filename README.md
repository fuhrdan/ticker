This is a file that will show live information from stocks based on the VOO.csv  
Currently VOO.csv in this file only holds the header information
VOO.csv originally held all of the information for VOO (which is what this program was based off of), but it can be adjusted for any amount of stock information.  When you click on a box, it will bring up additional information for you based on the stock in the box.
IF a stock is listed with a period, change it to a dash.  For instance, if it is BRK.B you will need to change it to BRK-B otherwise there will be a "not found" error, and the box in this will remain blank.

OVERALL use this as a hobby program, not for actual use in a production settings.

you will need to install yfinance (pip install yfinance) AND you will need ot instal tkinter (pip install tkinter) to make this program work.
